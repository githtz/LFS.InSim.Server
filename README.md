# LFS.InSim.Server

Originally this was a project to individualise the LFS experience for alle players on the Servers of the TOFU[â€¢] racing team back in 2010. Today, this repository is open for everyone to have a look at my first messy attepts of coding Java and how that mess can be cleaned up. Enjoy.
